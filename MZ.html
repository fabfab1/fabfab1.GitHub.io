    <p>During my many years as a collaborator in the ‘Tell Mozan/Urkesh
      Archaeological Project’ – most recently as Field Director – I developed my
      ability to work in a team as well as a broad skillset in all practical
      aspects of archaeological fieldwork. Despite the present difficulties in
      Syria, the Project and my involvement in it remain active, following local
      staff who document conditions, maintain conserved architecture and guide
      the local visitors who come to the site. My involvement also includes my
      own research as well as following a team of collaborators who are laying
      the groundwork for an eco-archaeological park centered around Tell Mozan.
    </p>
    <p>Since 2010 the war in Syria has been such that excavations at the site of
      Tell Mozan have no longer been possible; work has, however, continued as
      the ‘Urkesh Extended Project’. As field director for the project and as
      Deputy Director of IIMAS, the research institute which supports the
      excavations, I follow 6 local staff members still working at the site in
      Syria, where they continue work on conservation, photographic
      documentation, ceramic statistics and the vectorizing of hand drawings. </p>
    <p>This is a unique project, as our team is the only foreign mission
      continuously active on-site throughout this period of crisis, albeit
      remotely for non-Syrian staff. While excavation is not possible, our
      commitment to cultural heritage in time of war is an important statement
      of solidarity in addition to continuing a program of archaeological
      research. The project has resonated with colleagues, the media and funding
      agencies, and has lead to several important exhibitions, including one in
      Syria. The archival material from the site, including a wide range of
      elements of material culture and their stratigraphic contexts, is a
      treasure trove for research and teaching.</p>
