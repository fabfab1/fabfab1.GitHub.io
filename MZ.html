                / Urkesh Archaeological Project</a> began in 1984, and continues
              to be an active project today. Tell Mozan is located in northeast
              Syria in the Khabur river basin; the Tell is the site of ancient
              Urkesh, a city associated with the Hurrians. Its origins are lost
              in time, but the earliest remains found at the site extend to the
              early fourth millennium B.C. The city's prosperity was due in part
              to its position between the copper-rich highlands to the north and
              the cities of the Mesopotamian heartland to the south. It took
              almost a decade of work before the archaeologists were able to
              determine that Tell Mozan was the ancient city of Urkesh. Clay
              seal impressions depicted the royal family and members of the
              royal court, and yielded precious information about the city’s
              history. The uncovered remains of this ancient city include a
              palace, a temple, an open plaza, and an <i>abi</i>, a large
              underground structure tied to necromantic rituals.</p>

    <p> As Field Director for the Tell Mozan / Urkesh Archaeological Project, I
      was directly responsible for reaching the scientific goals set out in the
      beginning of the season; this entailed two to three month yearly seasons
      in the field, with a staff of thirty and a workforce of between 100 and
      150. This was a major responsibility, as I had to do justice to the most
      minute nuances of a complex urban stratigraphy, as well as deal with the
      organizational, practical and personnel aspects of any field project. My
      strong concern for a broader fruition of the results also lead me to wider
      efforts at communicating them to local stakeholders, as, working for so
      many years at the site together, we were all conscious of the significance
      of recovering a new chapter in the history of ancient Syria, that of the
      Hurrians.</p>
    <p> Despite the present difficulties in Syria, the project and my
      involvement in it remain active, following local staff who document
      conditions, maintain conserved architecture and guide the few local
      visitors who come to the site. My involvement also includes my own
      research as well as following a team of collaborators who are laying the
      groundwork for an eco-archaeological park centered around Tell Mozan. </p>
