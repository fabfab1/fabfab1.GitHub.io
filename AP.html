            <p> Having excavated several portions of the AP Palace, built for
              King Tupkish and used in a later phase by Tar'am-Agade, the
              daughter of Naram-Sin, I published an analysis of the edifice
              within the Urkesh/Mozan Studies Series (volume 6, = BM30). Besides
              offering a detailed architectural analysis of the structure, it
              deals extensively with methodology as a way to draw significant
              conclusions about the economy and the social setting that made its
              construction possible.</p>
            <p> The analysis in chapters 2 and 6 is a major contribution to our
              understanding of the public buildings of ancient Urkesh, and of
              palaces from this region and time period. As a part of this
              analysis the proportion of perimeter to area was used to support
              typological definitions of rooms and an access analysis were used.
              These methods are seldom (if ever) used in the field, but show
              promise within the framework of architectural analysis.</p>

    <p> A second portion of the monograph focuses on an understanding of the
      process of construction, combining data from the archaeological record,
      ethnographic parallels and textual evidence. This approach gives a deep
      understanding of the process of construction in general, as well as giving
      a series of 'algorithms' I developed from several sources (archaeological
      record, experimental archaeology, anthropological studies, textual
      sources) by which one can quantify the energy invested in the construction
      project. These algorithms are applicable in general to structures in stone
      and mudbrick, and as such can be used to define and compare the 'cost' and
      value of such structures in a meaningful way. This proposes an objective
      standard of measurement that can be used not only in archaeological, but
      also in an ethnographic context.</p>
    <p> The theoretical considerations brought up in chapter 4 introduce aspects
      of theory which can be tied to the data presented in this study. Such a
      link between theory and data is fundamental, and strengthens the
      understanding of both. One strength of the approach lies in the direct tie
      between the archaeological record and a discussion of more abstract
      concepts such as ‘monumentality’ and ‘prestige’.</p>

    <p> The monograph then presents a 3D model of the AP Palace at Tell Mozan,
      done not as an aesthetically appealing product, but as an organic research
      tool which can adapt to a changing archaeological reality as well as be a
      heuristic model. Such a model, done 'for archaeologists, by
      archaeologists', is a versatile tool for archaeology, and has real benefit
      in both formulating and answering research questions, both in the course
      of fieldwork as well as in secondary analyses. This 3D model is a telling
      example of how such a model can contribute to reaching the research goals.</p>
    <p> The methodological approach to architectural analysis done hand in hand
      with ethnographic data and combined with 3D modeling techniques allows for
      the application of the general algorithms gained in the third chapter to
      the specific volumetrics of the Urkesh Palace. Such an approach allows
      archaeologists to better understand concepts such as the value of
      materials in architecture as related to studies of energetics; an approach
      which highlights both the individuality of this structure while placing it
      in a number of very interesting contexts, such as other Mesopotamian
      monumental structures or palaces from other cultural contexts.</p>
