    <h2>The Palace of Tupkish</h2>
    <p> During my fieldwork at Tell Mozan, ancient Urkesh, I spent several years
      as part of the team excavating the AP Palace. My interest in the structure
      continued, and it became the topic of my dissertation and first monograph:</p>
    <h4> Three-dimensional Volumetric Analysis in an Archaeological Context: <br>
      The Palace of Tupkish at Urkesh and its Representation</h4>
    <h5> published with Undena Publications in 2016 in the <i>Bibliotheca
        Mesopotamica</i> series as <a href="http://www.undena.com/BM.html#30" target="_blank">volume
        30 / UMS 6</a> </h5>

    <p> The volume is the final publication of the Royal Palace of Urkesh, built
      around 2250 BC. Besides offering a detailed architectural analysis of the
      structure, it deals extensively with methodology as a way to draw
      significant conclusions about the economy and the social setting that made
      its construction possible. </p>
    <p> The analysis in chapters 2 and 6 is a major contribution to our
      understanding of the public buildings of ancient Urkesh, and of palaces
      from this region and time period. As a part of this analysis the
      proportion of perimeter to area was used to support typological
      definitions of rooms and an access analysis were used. These methods are
      seldom (if ever) used in the field, but show promise within the framework
      of architectural analysis.</p>
    <p> A second portion of the monograph focuses on an understanding of the
      process of construction, combining data from the archaeological record,
      ethnographic parallels and textual evidence. This approach gives a deep
      understanding of the process of construction in general, as well as giving
      a series of 'algorithms' I developed from several sources (archaeological
      record, experimental archaeology, anthropological studies, textual
      sources) by which one can quantify the energy invested in the construction
      project. These algorithms are applicable in general to structures in stone
      and mudbrick, and as such can be used to define and compare the 'cost' and
      value of such structures in a meaningful way. This proposes an objective
      standard of measurement that can be used not only in archaeological, but
      also in an ethnographic context.</p>
    <p> The theoretical considerations brought up in chapter 4 introduce aspects
      of theory which can be tied to the data presented in this study. Such a
      link between theory and data is fundamental, and strengthens the
      understanding of both. One strength of the approach lies in the direct tie
      between the archaeological record and a discussion of more abstract
      concepts such as ‘monumentality’ and ‘prestige’.</p>
    <p> The monograph then presents a 3D model of the AP Palace at Tell Mozan,
      done not as an aesthetically appealing product, but as an organic research
      tool which can adapt to a changing archaeological reality as well as be a
      heuristic model. Such a model, done 'for archaeologists, by
      archaeologists', is a versatile tool for archaeology, and has real benefit
      in both formulating and answering research questions, both in the course
      of fieldwork as well as in secondary analyses. This 3D model is a telling
      example of how such a model can contribute to reaching the research goals.</p>
    <p> The methodological approach to architectural analysis done hand in hand
      with ethnographic data and combined with 3D modeling techniques allows for
      the application of the general algorithms gained in the third chapter to
      the specific volumetrics of the Urkesh Palace. Such an approach allows
      archaeologists to better understand concepts such as the value of
      materials in architecture as related to studies of energetics; an approach
      which highlights both the individuality of this structure while placing it
      in a number of very interesting contexts, such as other Mesopotamian
      monumental structures or palaces from other cultural contexts.</p>
