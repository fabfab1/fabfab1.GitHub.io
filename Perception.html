    <h2>Perception</h2>
    <p> Space, as an expression of the architectural volumes expressed in
      Mesopotamian palatial architecture, can seem an abstract, distant concept,
      visible but not understood, and lacking interaction. These volumes,
      however, carry a deeper meaning: they conditioned and were affected by the
      daily life of a civilization which is lost in a remote past. By analyzing
      these architectural spaces with a view towards understanding aspects of
      style and perception, one can go beyond mere ‘space’ as a volume to the
      familiarity of ‘place’ - a deeper recognition and understanding of what a
      volume contains, beyond the merely spatial.</p>
    <p> If one takes style to be the recursive choice of non mandatory traits,1
      then in the case of architecture this choice is particularly conditioned
      by the concrete needs that a building is intended to serve. Take the case
      of a courtyard: it is not only a node within the communication network of
      spaces (the link for access to different rooms) but also an open space
      where certain activities must take place that cannot be carried out
      indoors; it provides more space for activities that require a larger
      number of people than could easily be accommodated in a roofed space; it
      serves as a source of light for rooms that front it and that cannot have
      windows or other openings; it offers a sense of perceptual intimacy being
      totally enclosed by rooms without access to the outside. And so on. </p>
    <p> Perception is also linked to the choices made during the construction
      and use of the structure, but approaches them from a different direction:
      these choices are aimed (one can posit) at an effect in the audience. The
      question one must ask, before even considering the question, is this: is
      there a uniformity of experience by means of which we, as modern audience,
      can attempt to understand what the ancients perceived?</p>
    <p> While the understanding of ancient material culture wholly through the
      lens of modern cultural norms would not lead anywhere (and would be
      scientifically unsound, to say the least) there is a level at which this
      uniformity does link modernity with the past, even the distant past. In
      his book on Maya architecture, Abrams expresses this uniformity in terms
      of the impression that architecture imparts: “One intriguing and perhaps
      dominant aspect of architecture at any large archaeological site is that
      the scale and quality of these structures have a profound impression on
      the observer. Archaeologists, from the moment they enter a site until the
      final analyses of data, are ultimately observers and interpreters of those
      observations. The leitmotiv [...] is that the initial observation of large
      architectural accomplishments has a tremendous impact on our impressions
      and interpretations, just as the elite who commissioned such projects had
      originally intended” (Abrams 1994, xii). An examination of this 'timeless'
      aspect in architecture can be found in the writings of R. Arnheim, where
      he deals explicitly with the effect that architecture has on a human
      visitor – and his unstated claim is that these effects are not culturally
      specific, but are true on a universal level. The difficulty is in
      determining the point at which our cultural norms influence the
      archaeologist's understanding of the cultural material under study – and
      since there is no litmus test for this, the question must be repeatedly
      asked as that understanding grows. </p>
    <p> Perception, then, can be an aim of study for archaeology – and can form
      the toolkit with which to explore a series of questions relating to
      ancient ideas of monumentality and prestige. </p>
