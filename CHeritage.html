    <h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
    <p> For me, the diverse forms of communication between archaeologists and
      local audiences are one of the fundamental components of Cultural
      Heritage. My research looks at how the culture and day-to-day life of an
      ancient civilization can best be communicated to local audiences, in
      particular for archaeologists working in countries where they themselves
      are foreigners. Three aspects are of particular relevance: the diverse
      approaches to local, regional, national and international audiences,
      archaeology as a building block of modern social identity, and finally
      ethical considerations regarding the active role that a foreign
      archaeologist may play in a modern cultural context. Here I draw on my
      years of experience working in Syria and presenting the results a diverse
      set of audiences, from biweekly site talks to local staff to presentations
      in European universities and to corporate sponsors. </p>
    <p> Cultural Heritage involves a wide spectrum, working from an individual
      level to community and beyond to the wider society, as well as on a
      scholarly level: On an individual level, one of the most important aspects
      of cultural heritage is a commonality of perception – not only visual, but
      including sound, smell and touch as well. The ancients constructed their
      material world based on interactions; these interactions can still be
      studied today, because the experiential frame of reference is the same.
      This also speaks to the debate on authenticity vs. ‘pastness’ - the
      experience is shared only when the environment comes directly from the
      archaeological record.</p>
    <p>Cultural heritage also speaks to the community of stakeholders in which
      an archaeological project is embedded. Over many years in archaeology I
      have given dozens of weekly lectures to stakeholders – this interaction
      with local communities has given an immense strength and resilience to the
      Mozan project, as it became evident in the Syrian conflict. Despite the
      crisis, the project continues to employ six local staff whom I am
      supervising. This great success is also due to the sense of pride that the
      local community has in the site. </p>
    <p>Cultural Heritage has also an impact on a wider level. The current
      conflict in Syria has seen targeted destruction in many museums and
      cultural sites – this is not an example of random violence, nor is it done
      to ‘spite’ western sensibilities. Instead, the destruction of cultural
      heritage is an attempt to remold national (or regional) identity by
      destroying select material elements of the past. By choosing what to
      destroy and what to keep, pretenders to political power bring to the fore
      those traditions which benefit them in a two-way legitimization process.
      Rather ironically, one of the first examples of such an attempt at
      legitimization can be found in one of the traditions at risk from ISIS
      today – the King of Shekna, Shamshi-Addu.</p>
    <p> There is an inherent risk in the presence of foreign scholars working
      with communities and contributing to elements which form a social identity
      – colonialism. As archaeologists, we are called to ‘stage the past’ in a
      myriad of ways, from a scholarly article to interviews given on
      television. And since the ‘stage’ and the ‘play’ are intrinsically
      intertwined on several different levels, the message received by an
      audience may be ‘charged’ in a way that its author never intended. The
      strength of studies focused on Cultural Heritage is that these levels of
      interplay between the past and the present become a subject of scrutiny,
      better enabling all archaeologists to craft their message in order to
      better communicate to their audience. </p>
