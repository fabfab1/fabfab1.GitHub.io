    <h5> Cultural Heritage – Individual</h5>
    <p> Cultural Heritage involves a wide spectrum, working from an individual
      level to community and beyond to the wider society, as well as on a
      scholarly level. On an individual level, one of the most important aspects
      of cultural heritage is a commonality of perception – not only visual, but
      including sound, smell and touch as well. The ancients constructed their
      material world based on interactions; these interactions can still be
      studied today, because the experiential frame of reference is the same. To
      provide a modern visitor the chance to experience ancient architecture
      speaks to a ‘shared’ experience. This also speaks to the debate on
      authenticity vs. ‘pastness’ - the experience is shared only when the
      environment comes directly from the archaeological record. My own work in
      Mozan has focused on aspects of perception in an excavation environment in
      the area of the temple terrace (see my article “The Monumental Temple
      Terrace at Urkesh and its Setting” submitted with this application) as
      well as the AP Palace, where the conservation program included aspects of
      visibility. </p>
    <h5> Cultural Heritage – Community </h5>
    <p>Cultural Heritage also speaks to the community in which an archaeological
      field project is embedded. The concept of stakeholders has particular
      meaning within the Tell Mozan project. Over the many years in the field, I
      have given dozens of lectures to the local workmen, which were regularly
      conducted on a weekly basis. This constant interaction, over years, helped
      build stakeholders. Further lectures I gave in whole or in part were to
      local schoolchildren, association members (such as architects), local
      municipal workers and of course visitors, whether tourists or dignitaries.
      This interaction with local communities has given an immense strength and
      resilience to the Mozan project, as it became evident in the last five
      years, since archaeological fieldwork became impossible. Despite the
      difficulties facing the area, the project continues to employ six local
      staff whom I am supervising through various intermediate channels; they
      document (using digital photography) changing conditions at the site,
      record pottery lots from earlier seasons, digitize old records and
      maintain the conservation structures. This great success is also due to
      the sense of pride that the local community has in the site, where those
      people who came to know the site while being excavated (mayors, water
      departments, cultural centers in addition to local residents) are now
      those defending it. </p>
    <h5> Cultural Heritage – Society </h5>
    <p>Cultural Heritage has also an impact on a wider level. The current
      conflict in Syria has seen targeted destruction in many museums and
      cultural sites – this is not an example of random violence, nor is it done
      to ‘spite’ western sensibilities. Instead, the destruction of cultural
      heritage is an attempt to remold national (or regional) identity by
      destroying select material elements of the past. By choosing what to
      destroy and what to keep, pretenders to political power bring to the fore
      those traditions which benefit them in a two-way legitimization process.
      Rather ironically, one of the first examples of such an attempt at
      legitimization can be found in one of the traditions at risk today in the
      ISIS controlled territories – the King of Shekna, Shamshi-Addu, conquers a
      large swath of Mesopotamia in the early part of the second millennium BC,
      founding what is known today as the Paleo-Assyrian empire. In an attempt
      to legitimize his claim to the newly-conquered city of Assur, he has his
      scribes write a list of kings showing his hereditary claim to the throne.
      This king-list is as clearly fictitious today as it would have been to
      Shamshi-Addu’s peers. Such ties between the past and the present show both
      continuity in questions of political legitimization as well as the
      importance of understanding the past as formative for the present. </p>
    <h5> Cultural Heritage – Scholarship </h5>
    <p>There is an inherent risk in the presence of foreign scholars working
      with communities and contributing to elements which form a social identity
      – colonialism. As archaeologists, we are called to ‘stage the past’ in a
      myriad of ways, from a scholarly article to interviews given on
      television. And since the ‘stage’ and the ‘play’ (to continue the
      metaphor) are intrinsically intertwined on several different levels, the
      message received by an audience may be ‘charged’ in a way that its author
      never intended. The strength of studies focused on Heritage and Politics
      of the Past is that these levels of interplay between the past and the
      present become a subject of scrutiny, better enabling all archaeologists
      to craft their message in order to better communicate to their audience.
      Further, cultural heritage studies can aid us in being better
      archaeologists in that the conceptual framework developed for the modern
      world can also aid us in understanding the past; such an effort should be
      intrinsic to the discipline, but is often sidelined to the detriment of
      the field. By abiding by these principles, I feel that a live concern for
      cultural heritage has contributed not only to the awareness of the
      stakeholders for their past, but to the archaeology as well. The Mozan
      project has been recognized for these qualities, and I feel that when,
      hopefully, I am able to resume my work at the site I will continue to
      blend the two aspects and develop the project further to make even more
      responsive to these critical needs.</p>
    <h5> Cultural Heritage – Legal and Political Aspects </h5>
    <p> In May of 2014 I gave a paper with the title “A Stakeholder Success
      Story: The Eco-Archaeological Park at Tell Mozan, Syria” in the Culture
      Under Threat: The Future of the Hague Convention Conference jointly
      organized by the WAC Inter-Congress, Blue Shield, Newcastle University,
      and American University in Rome. This gave me the opportunity to meet
      several people in the field, in particular P. Stone and P. Gerstenblith.
      My contribution was based on my extensive work at Tell Mozan during the
      last few years during the crisis in Syria, and included aspects of ethics
      and safeguards for cultural heritage which were missing in Syria and might
      aid other countries to avoid some of the same problems. As the only
      speaker presenting material from an archaeological excavation, the example
      of Tell Mozan was quite useful in the following discussions on the
      formulation of a WAC statement regarding cultural heritage. I have also
      participated in UNESCO organized meetings such as the “Follow-up to the
      implementation of the UNESCO Action Plan for the Emergency Safeguarding of
      Syria’s Cultural Heritage” held in Berlin (June 2016). </p>
