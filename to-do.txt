Something doesn't quite seem right though, and I can't quite put my finger on it: perhaps I miss the oomph of the whole. Is it that the fields (the rectangles) seem only juxtaposed, a series of things you do, which are all on the same level and do not quite point to the central excellence of your persona? -- I would say it is really only an aesthetic concern -- in other words, you should certainly work on the individual sections, and think in the meantime about the home page
